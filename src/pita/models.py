        field2 = models.IntegerField()

    * Note that id (pk) values might be different from how they were at the past time, but the row_id attribute will be the same
    * Note too that related fields are not preserved in the past versions unless frozen fields are used in the related models.

    You can use a PointInTimeModel just like a regular Django model, and access historical information whenever you need to.

    Each row describes a state that is true (or thought to be true) for some amount of time. The state may change, and
    the row becomes inactive. The row may also be changed due to a new discovery/realized mistake, and have its replaced_at set and a new row
    with the correction added, otherwise identical to the first.
    None in either end_at or replaced_at is taken to be unspecified, or +infinity

    This model managers provides methods for such functions:
    objects, the default manager can be used without client noticing the difference between this model and those with typical architectures
    objects.all() returns all up-to-date rows (acts like regular table architecture)
    objects.active(active_at=timezone.now()): returns a queryset of the most up-to-date row for each record where start_at <= active_at < end_at
    records, on the other hand, provides access into PITA properties of the model
    records.all() returns all rows (exposes PITA architecture and underlying replaced rows)
    records.active(active_at=timezone.now()): alias for objects.active
    records.version(version_at): returns a queryset of all rows created but not yet replaced by time; ie. created_at <= version_at < replaced_at

    active also works as a queryset method, so records.version(version_at).active(active_at) returns
    You can use records.active(timezone.now()) for up-to-date records of current state, and records.filter(replaced_at__isnull=True) for all up-to-date records

    purge is a method that removes all instances of the row from the database - deleting it entirely. Note that this side steps the PITA
    principle so it should be used with caution.

    rollback_latest and rollback_to_at are methods which provide the functionality of returning a row to a previous state the instance was saved at
    (either the last one or to one from
    a particular time). These permanently lose information of edits after the version they rollback to, so they should be used with caution.

    When creating an object of a PointInTimeModel, the following attributes are allowed kwargs:
    start_at: the datetime at which the record becomes active and applies to a real world state. Default = timezone.now()
    end_at: the datetime at which the record will cease to be accurate of the real world state. Default = None
    modified_by: the user associated with creating this record. Default = None

    The following attributes are not allowed as kwargs, and will be ignored if supplied:
    row_id: an internally used reference to the pk of the latest version of the record
    created_at: the datetime at which the record is created and added to the database
    replaced_at: the datetime at which this record gets modified and replaced by a more up-to-date row for the record
    A form for a PITAModel should exclude those fields in PointInTimeModel.EXCLUDE

    Note: that we chose to use row_id to connect multiple versions of the same record instead of using a separate table,
    as this provides clarity and simplicity without a significant drawback. In situations where a foreign key field is useful,
    clients can safely use one from the subclass of PointInTimeModel, as the default manager, objects, will only provide
    up-to-date versions of rows as related objects.

    Note: the surrogate id (alias pk) field is stable moving forward. For example, if you create an object and make changes to it, it's pk will stay the same.

    Note: purge and rollback each get their own permission by default, but if you are specifying permissions in the subclass, you should use
    permissions = PointInTimeModel.Meta.permissions + [your custom permissions]

    Porting an existing model to PITA:
    -Inherit PointInTimeModel
    -makemigrations (set a default for created_at and start_time; these can be timezone.now())
    -Loop over every object in the model and do the following
        obj.row_id = obj.id
